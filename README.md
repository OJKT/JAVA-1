// Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.
var a = 7;
var b = a;

// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 9;

//Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
//like this
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar = 10;
var properCamelCase = "A String";
var titleCaseOver = 9000;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

//Not like this
// Declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;

//We can subtract one number from another multiply, divide and adition.

//JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

//Example

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
myVar = 10 + 10; //assigned 20
myVar = 12 * 6; //assigned 72
myVar = 66 / 33; //assigned 33


/*i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.*/

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
//above is wrong... use
myVar++;
//same works with --;
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

var myDecimal = 10.98;

//we can multiply & divide

var product = 2.0 * 2.5; //assigned 5

var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Assigned 2.2

var remainder = 11 % 3; //remainder gets the value 2
